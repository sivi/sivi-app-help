# Brand setup

Sivi makes it easy to set up your brand kit so all your marketing creatives stay consistent from day one.

1. After signing up, enter your website URL during the onboarding.

2. Prefer to add brand details manually? You can do that too by selecting the Manual option.

3. Sivi will automatically pull your brand details from the website and add them to the Brand Kit. This includes logo, company name, description, social handles, images, colors, and typography.
