# Multilingual ad campaign

EKDN Plumbing has expanded its services across Canada. To connect with more customers, they're running a display ad campaign in both French and English. They begin by adding a prompt and uploading brand assets for the French banner ads.

From the ad copy and image suggestions Sivi provides, they pick what fits best.

In seconds, Sivi generates French ad designs - ready to go live.

Next, they switch the language to English using the same input.

Just like that, they have a full set of English banner ads too. EKDN Plumbing now has an ad campaign in multiple languages tailored for its growing audience.
