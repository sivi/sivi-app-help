# One prompt for 3 platforms

IronForm Fitness Studio is a fitness center offering strength training. To kick off their Summer Fitness Challenge, they want to promote it with an Instagram square post and website banner.

They begin by entering a simple prompt into Sivi to create an Instagram square post. To keep branding consistent, they upload their brand assets.

From the content suggestions, they pick what fits best.

Without starting from scratch, they create website banners by just adjusting the design size using custom width and height.
