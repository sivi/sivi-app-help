# Welcome to Sivi AI

Thanks for checking out Sivi. We're here to make design simple, fast, and truly yours.

Sivi is a generative AI design tool that instantly turns your prompt into business visuals like display ads, social media posts, website banners, and more, without templates or design skills.

## Why Sivi?

Most AI tools generate a single image. Sivi creates editable, multi-layered designs you can actually use in your marketing.

Here's how Sivi is different:

| AI design generator/Sivi AI | AI image generators |
| --- | --- |
| Built for layered, vector-based design generation | Built for single-layered, raster-based image generation |
| Uses your brand assets and text pixel-perfectly | Given logos, images, and texts gets distorted |
| Customize fonts, colors, buttons, and more | Minimal control over image generation |
| Supports platform-specific and custom design sizes | Limited dimensions/aspect ratio support |
| Edit individual elements without affecting others | One mask and edit can distort the whole image |

**Design = Text + Images + Logo + Shapes + Colors**
