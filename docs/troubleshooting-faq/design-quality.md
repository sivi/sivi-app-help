# Why are certain designs not up to the mark?

If a design doesn’t look quite right, don’t worry, it happens! A few common things can affect quality:

- **Vague prompts**: Unclear or conflicting instructions confuse the AI  
- **Missing brand assets**: No logo, images, or colors? The AI has less to work with  
- **Overly complex asks**: Super detailed requests can be hard to nail  
- **Wrong dimensions**: Some content works better in certain sizes  
- **AI limits**: It’s smart, but still learning the finer creative touches  

## How to Get Better Results

- Write clear prompts  
- Add high-res logos, quality images, brand colors, and fonts  
- Use the edit tool, try small changes to your prompt, or explore different styles  
- Adjust tone, layout, or design style for more variety  

Remember that AI design is an iterative process. The more you use Sivi and provide clear inputs, the better the results will get!
