# Why does generation fail sometimes?

If a design fails to generate, your credits won't be used. You can try again without losing anything.

Here are a few common reasons for generation failures:

### System-related Issues:
- Temporary server overload  
- Scheduled maintenance  
- Network connectivity problems  

### Account-related Issues:
- Insufficient credits  
- Expired subscription  
- Account restrictions  

### Content-related Issues:
- Prohibited content in prompts  
- Extremely complex requests  
- Corrupted reference images  


## How to Fix It

- **System issues**: Wait and retry, check your connection, or try a different browser.  
- **Account issues**: Check your credits, subscription status, and payment info.  
- **Content issues**: Simplify prompts, avoid restricted terms, or remove images.  



**Still stuck?**  
Contact support with your prompt, error message, and any images used.
