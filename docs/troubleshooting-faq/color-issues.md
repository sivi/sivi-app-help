# What contributes to the poor choice of colors at times?

When there are no colors in the styles, Sivi automatically selects color palettes by analyzing the tone, emotions, etc., derived from the provided content. However, there is a chance that it may occasionally make incorrect color choices.  

An alternative approach is to add your preferred colors to the design styles. For step-by-step instructions, check out this article on <a href="../design-generation/generation-settings">adding colors</a>.

It's worth noting that even when the model selects the right palettes, there could be instances where it produces poor contrast. We are actively working on improving this aspect.
