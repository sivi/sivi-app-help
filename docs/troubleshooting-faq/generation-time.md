# Why does the generation take minutes?

Unlike Template Tools, ivi composes everything from scratch to match your exact needs. That means it:

- Understands your prompt (tone, goals, content)  
- Analyzes the chosen copy and images  
- Builds layouts without templates  
- Applies your brand assets and style  
- Optimizes for your selected size or platform  


## How Long Does It Take?

- **Simple designs** (like social posts): ~1 minute  
- **More complex designs** (with multiple elements): ~2 minutes  

Sivi takes a little time to deliver unique, high-quality, on-brand visuals — and it’s worth the wait!
