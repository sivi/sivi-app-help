# Workspace

A workspace in Sivi is your dedicated area to manage all your brand kits, generation preferences, and saved designs.

Workspaces are especially useful if you're handling more than one business. For example, digital agencies can create separate workspaces for each client, keeping their logos, brand colors, font styles, and content preferences neatly separated.

With workspace:
<ul>
  <li>Set up unique brand kits</li>
  <li>Define design generation preferences</li>
  <li>Create and store visuals specific to that brand</li>
  <li>Keep client work organized</li>
</ul>
