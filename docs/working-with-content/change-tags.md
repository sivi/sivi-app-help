# Change tags

As you add the design content, Sivi will tag it automatically. You can also add it manually as mentioned in the <a href="./content-blocks">Content Blocks</a> article.

If you want to fine-tune it later to best suit your design needs, you can easily change the tags.

1. Click the tag on the left side of the content block.  
    <img src="/img/working-with-content/change-tags/1_change-tags_click-tag.png" alt="Change tags-Click tag" />
2. Scroll through the tags and select the required one.
