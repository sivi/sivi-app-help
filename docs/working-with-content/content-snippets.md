# Content snippets

Let's say that you are an e-commerce marketer new to Sivi and want to design ads. Instead of starting with a blank page, you can use Snippets.  
'Snippets' are pre-defined content that can help you explore, understand, and store content in Sivi.  
With 'Examples', you can choose a sample snippet that is similar to your content and edit it based on your needs. To add that:

1. Click 'Snippets' on the left panel.  
      <img src="/img/working-with-content/content-snippets/1_content-snippets_click-snippets.png" alt="Content snippets-Click snippets" />
2. Select the 'Examples' section on the top. Scroll through the purposes and choose the one that suits your content.  
      <img src="/img/working-with-content/content-snippets/2_content-snippets_select-examples.png" alt="Content snippets-Select examples" />
3. Click on a content snippet to add it to the Content Editor.  
      <img src="/img/working-with-content/content-snippets/3_content-snippets_add-to-editor.png" alt="Content snippets-Add to editor" />
4. Edit the content and add your assets if required.
