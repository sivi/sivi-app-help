# Primary asset

When you add an asset, it becomes the primary asset by default and automatically gets marked as 'important', which means it will get highlighted in the generated design. If you want two asset blocks and wish to highlight the second one, you have to:

1. Click the dot on the left side of the Asset block.  
   <img src="/img/working-with-content/primary-asset/1_primary-asset_click-dot.png" alt="Primary asset-Click dot" />
2. Select 'Important' from the options.  
   <img src="/img/working-with-content/primary-asset/2_primary-asset_select-important.png" alt="Primary asset-Select important" />

Now the second asset becomes the primary asset.
