# Bulleted list

Let's say you are about to design creatives highlighting the features of your online grocery store. You can make the content clear by organizing them as a bulleted list. To add such a list in Sivi:

1. Type "/" and choose the 'Bulleted List' block.  
   <img src="/img/working-with-content/bulleted-list/1_bulleted-list_select-bulleted-list-block.png" alt="Bulleted list-Select bulleted list block" />
2. After each point in the list, press 'enter' to add a new point.  
   <img src="/img/working-with-content/bulleted-list/2_bulleted-list_add-new-point.png" alt="Bulleted list-Add new point" />
3. Click on the empty space below to exit the list and add other content blocks.
