# Content score

Let's consider you want to compose a blog cover design for a post on compact home interior ideas. You keep adding content that you want to be featured in the design. But how do you know whether the content is becoming excessive or too little for the chosen design dimensions?

This is where your guiding light - the Content Score - will help you. Positioned at the top right of the content editor, it evaluates the content using the following parameters:

1. Content Ratio: The ratio of text and images to the design size.

2. Hierarchy: The order in which the inputs are fed.

3. Call To Action: Presence of a CTA option.

4. Semantic Tagging: Proper tagging of the inputs (Title, Button, Contact, Image, Person, etc.).

A higher score indicates better generated designs and a score of 100 means your content is a perfect fit!
