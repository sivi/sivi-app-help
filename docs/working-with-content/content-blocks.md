# Content blocks

In Content Editor, every piece of content is added as a block. Content Block refers to a distinct piece of information, a list, images, copy, or any other element that has to be included in your visual design.

1. You can add blocks to the Content Editor with the Slash command. Type “/” to look at the list of possible content blocks in the menu.

2. After typing “/” you can continue typing to search for a specific content block.  
      <img src="/img/working-with-content/content-blocks/2_content-blocks_search-specific-block.png" alt="Content blocks-Search specific block" />
3. Select a content block in the menu to add it to the Content Editor and start typing the content.

Once the content block is added, tags/semantics on the left represent the type of content block. Tags help Sivi understand your intent and generate designs accordingly. To change the tag, visit the <a href="./change-tags">Change Tags</a> article.
