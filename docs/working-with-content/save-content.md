# Save content

Imagine you are an e-commerce marketer running campaigns regularly for different products but with a similar content structure. In that case, you might want to save the content for future use.

1. After adding content in Content Editor, click 'Add to favorites' on the top.

2. Go to Snippets and click 'Favorites' to find this content which can be reused whenever needed.
