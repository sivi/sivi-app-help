# Add buttons

Consider that you want to generate a design for your upcoming sale. You want to turn your CTA into an eye-catching button that leads customers to your latest promotions.

1. You can manually add tags with slash commands. Type "/button", choose the Button from the menu, and add your CTA.

2. Or type your CTA in a new line and Sivi will automatically tag it as Button.
