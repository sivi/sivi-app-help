# Move blocks

After adding the copy to Content Editor, let's say you want to rearrange it to create coherent messaging. Then:

1. Hover over a content block and click the options icon on the right side.  
        <img src="/img/working-with-content/move-blocks/1_move-blocks_click-options-icon.png" alt="Move blocks-Click options icon" />
2. Click the up or down arrow to move it.  
        <img src="/img/working-with-content/move-blocks/2_move-blocks_click-arrows.png" alt="Move blocks-Click arrows" />
