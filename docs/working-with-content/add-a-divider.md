# Add a divider

Imagine you are creating an ad for your travel agency's Thailand package. To ensure your audience can easily spot your contact details from other information, you can divide the content into sections.

1. Add a new line between the content that needs to be separated and type "/divider".  
   <img src="/img/working-with-content/add-a-divider/1_add-a-divider_add-divider-command.png" alt="Add a divider-Add divider command" />
2. Select 'Divider' block from the menu.
