Why does the generation take minutes?,Troubleshooting FAQ,"We have optimized the generation process to be as fast as possible. However it still takes some time to get picked up from the queue.

Here's an overview of the generation process:
<ol>
  <li>The request is added to the queue.</li>
  <li>Copy and images are analyzed.</li>
  <li>Designs are composed and colors are added.</li>
</ol>

Typically this entire process takes around a minute.

There are instances where generation may take longer than usual and these include:
<ol>
  <li>Increased parallel generation requests which require additional time to process from the queue.</li>
  <li>Adding more assets as each image requires analysis leading to extended processing times.</li>
</ol>"
Why do certain designs are not upto the mark?,Troubleshooting FAQ,"Sivi's design outcomes are an interplay between input and model capabilities. The quality of input including prompt and brand assets significantly influences the resulting designs. 

It's worth noting that despite providing good content there may be instances where certain designs fall short of expectations. In such cases the performance is attributed to the capabilities of the model. We are constantly dedicated to improving our models."
Why are the chosen images not relevant sometimes?,Troubleshooting FAQ,"Sivi understands your content and generates images with the AI image generator or picks images from its free stock library accordingly. Occasionally it may choose images that are not relevant. You have the flexibility to add your own images before generating the designs.
   
To know more about assets check out the <a href=""/support/design-assets"">Add assets</a> article"
What contributes to the poor choice of colors at times?,Troubleshooting FAQ,"When there are no colors in the styles Sivi automatically selects color palettes by analyzing the tone emotions etc. derived from the provided content. However there is a chance that it may occasionally make incorrect color choices.  

An alternative approach is to add your preferred colors to the design styles. For step-by-step instructions check out this article on <a href=""/support/brand-colors"">adding colors</a>.

It's worth noting that even when the model selects the right palettes there could be instances where it produces poor contrast. We are actively working on improving this aspect. "

Content score,Working with content,"Let’s consider you want to compose a blog cover design for a post on compact home interior ideas. You keep adding content that you want to be featured in the design. But how do you know whether the content is becoming excessive or too less for the chosen design dimensions?

This is where your guiding light - the Content Score - will help you. Positioned at the top right of the content editor it evaluates the content using the following parameters:
<ol>
<li>Content Ratio: The ratio of text and images to the design size</li>
<li>Hierarchy: The order in which the inputs are fed</li>
<li>Call To Action: Presence of a CTA option</li>
<li>Semantic Tagging: Proper tagging of the inputs (Title Button Contact Image Person etc.)</li>
</ol>

<img alt="""" src=""https://media.hellosivi.com/photos/sUb6ls5Wfkr.png"" />

A higher score indicates better generated designs and a score of 100 means your content is a perfect fit!"
